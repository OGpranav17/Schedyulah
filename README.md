## 💡 What Is Schedyulah?

**Schedyulah** is a ✨ beautiful, Pinteresty 🌸 productivity timer and tracker that asks:

> 💬 “What activity are you indulged in right now?”

Type in what you're working on (like *coding*, *studying*, or *manifesting your glow-up* 😌), and boom 💥 — a timer starts with your custom task name.

When you're done, hit stop ⏹️, and the site calculates your **focused time** ⏱️ vs **idle time** 😴  
You get a clear view of your *daily productivity gains* — like gym reps for your brain 🧠💪
